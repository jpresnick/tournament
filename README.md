# tournament
A Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament using the Swiss system.

## Files
### - tournament.py 
Contains the methods used to set up the tournament, including adding players, deleting players, running matches, and chekcing the standings.

### - tournament.sql
Contains the SQL table definitions for the tournament project.

## Requirements
This project requires that you have python dowloaded on your computer, and that you run a PostgreSQL database. I used 
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) and [VirtualBox] (https://www.virtualbox.org) to set up the database.
